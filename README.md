# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ UPDATE: MIGRATING TO Codeberg ⚠️⚠️⚠️

I am cutting ties with github and migrating all my open source work(even if barely maintained) to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/). There are several reasons for it but the major ones are privacy related and the idiotic "uSe mY aI brO, sO hElpFul, mUcH prOduCtiVe".

Sod off with your AI slop github(and any company that tries to push that crap down my throat.

Kind regards.
